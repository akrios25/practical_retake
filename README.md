# practical retake feedback
### I found the practical to be more doable this time around. The part that took me the longest time was adding the fragment to a recyclerview and adding the logic for the fragment itself where it multiples the numbers given. I am still unsure of how sharedpreferences works and need more thorough analysis on this, along with async tasks and the like. Suprisingly enough, I managed to finish the practical and complette the steps.
