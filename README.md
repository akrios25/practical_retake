# practical retake feedback
#### I found the practical to be more doable this time around. The part that took me the longest time was adding the fragment to a recyclerview and adding the logic for the fragment itself where it multiplies the numbers given. I am still unsure of how sharedpreferences works and need more thorough analysis on this, along with async tasks and the like. It was difficult knowing how to manage adapters, controllers and models and that would be something I'd need to also go over to understand how it works and interacts with the overall app.
